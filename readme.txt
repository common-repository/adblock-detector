Find out how many of your visitors are using ad blocking software.

== Description ==

The AdBlock Detector plugin helps publishers easily track how many visitors coming to their website are using ad blocking software.

The counter displays the numbers at a glance while the customizable reporting chart gives a more granular visual representation of the data related to the state of ad blocking on a publisher’s website.

The purpose of this plugin is to simply provide a broad sense to web publishers of the extent to which their ad impressions and viewable ad counts are being affected by users who have chosen to employ active ad blocking measures.

It is also possible to make rough estimates of how much revenue you’re losing on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis to ad blockers if you’re aware of your CTR and RPM.
